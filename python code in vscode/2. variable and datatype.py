Mapped / dictionary (dict)  dict: A dict is an unordered collection of data containing a 
key:value pair . The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets. {}
list 


tuple :-   Tupe is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by 
a comma and eclosed within paremeters. Tuples are immutable (not change) 
and cannot be modified after creation.
example:-
tuple1 = ('amit','Deepak')


Numeric data type

int , float , complex
10,   10.9 ,  (8,9)

text data : str (string)
Boolean (true or flase)
None (Nothing)
